# About

This repo contains a [github-pages deployment](https://al-ce.github.io/css-battle/) of a page I buit with my solutions for target challenges on [cssbattle.dev](cssbattle.dev).
I wanted some basic HTML/CSS practice to build on top of what I was practicing at CSSBattle.

On each Target's page, you'll find syntax-highlighted CSS/HTML that matches my solutions on CSSBattle as well as the recreated Target using CSS. The layout mimics the design of the CSSBattle.dev challenges.
